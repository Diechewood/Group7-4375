# Flask Backend Server

This repository contains the backend server code for a web application built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The backend server handles HTTP requests, manages database interactions, and serves as the applicationâ€™s core API.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for handling CRUD operations.
- MySQL database integration for data storage and retrieval.
- Environment variable management for secure configuration.
- Configurable for both local development and deployment in containerized environments (e.g., Docker).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- MySQL database setup and credentials configured in `.env` (see below)

### Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the `/Backend` directory to store database credentials:

    `dbusername=usernamehere`
    `dbpassword=passwordhere`
    

### Installation
    
1. Install the required dependencies:
    
    `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`
    

### Running the Server

1. Start the Flask server with the following command:
    
    `flask --app main.py run --host=0.0.0.0`


### Additional Notes

- **Database Setup**: Make sure your MySQL database is set up and accessible with the credentials provided in your `.env` file.
